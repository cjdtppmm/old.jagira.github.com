I build web applications for living and for fun. I also like to tinker
with servers and linux boxes. Here are some of the
applications that I built -

    <h2><a href="http://printfriendly.com">Printfriendly</a></h2>

    <p>Printfriendly makes print friendly version of any web page.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/jagira/newzupp">Newzupp</a></h2>

    <p>Newzupp is an online news aggregator. It aggregates news from leading
social news sites like Reddit, Tweetmeme, Digg, Facebook and
Hackernews. Newzupp aggregates and then processes the stories to find
the most popular stories at any given time.
</p>
    <p>I built the app using PHP in April 2010 in order to learn CodeIgniter framework. It got featured as
<a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/mashup/newzupp">Programmableweb's Mashup of the day</a> in April 2010.
<br/>
In early 2011, I migrated the app to Rails.</p>

    
    <p>Technologies Used - <em>Ruby on Rails, APIs of Digg, Reddit, Tweetmeme,
Facebook and Hackernews</em></p>
  
    <p>Work Done - <em>Everything</em></p>
