title: Why should every developer have a blog and some side projects?

Recently Mark Suster wrote a post on Techcrunch titled
"[Why Startups Need to Blog (and what to talk about …)](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/27/why-startups-need-to-blog-and-what-to-talk-about/)".
IMHO this applies to every developer as well.

I have been blogging since last 10 months. I started it without any
reason and kept on posting random stuff, mostly about Rails. I also
started a lot of side projects and disposed them in few days. But
last month, I decided to work on the project idea that was brewing
in my mind since months. With due diligence, I was able to pull it
off. \[Site - [Newzupp](http://newzupp.com "Newzupp") | Code -
[Github](http://github.com/jagira/newzupp "Newzupp - Source")\]

While I was working on it, I came accross Jason Fried's talk on
"[Sharing your recipes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks2saa38Id4)". Inspired
by Jason's talk, I
[blogged](http://jigarpatel.in/how-i-built-newzupp-in-30-hours)
about my experience of building Newzupp. A lot of people read it, a
few shared it and re-blogged it. I got few appreciation emails and
two awesome people working on cool products contacted me regarding
work/job. All of this stuff is quite encouraging and motivates me
to work on more projects, learn stuff and share it. IMHO every
developer should work on some side projects and maintain a blog.
Following are the observations based on my experience -

 

-   **You will gain recognition** - People who will read your blog
    will recognize you on other forums and in meetups.
-   **Your skills will be showcased** - There are millions of
    awesome devs in the world. You might be one of them, but nobody
    knows about your skills unless you showcase them. Blog and side
    projects are effective platforms to showcase your skills.
-   **Your writing skills will improve** - Developers usually do
    not like to write. But writing about your project and documenting
    it is as important as code quality. Blogging will certainly improve
    your writing skills.
-   **You will meet new people and make new friends** - I met some
    cool people via my blog.
-   **You might get work** **or job offers** - Your code and blog
    posts are more effective than your resume. People who have seen
    your work will approach you. And it always feels great when people
    approach you for work. Also, unlike interviews and job
    applications, these kind of offers are based on the work you have
    done and not on your past records or some awards/certificates that
    are mentioned in your resume.
-   **Side projects will increase your confidence** - No matter how
    small the project is, starting it and finishing it requires
    persistence and discipline. There are very few developers who can
    build something on their own without any extrinsic motivation
    (money, pressure etc). Being one of them feels motivating. Such
    small projects can gradually increase your discipline and improve
    your management skills.
