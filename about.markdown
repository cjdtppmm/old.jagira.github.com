Howdy! I am [Jigar](http://jigarpatel.in), a 25 year old coder from India. I like
building web applications using ruby/javascript and that earns
my bread and butter. I used to work with [IBM](http://ibm.com) and
[Vinsol](http://vinsol.com), but now I work independently, trying to
build a technology business. I have also worked as an Information
Security Auditor and have audited the IT infrastructure for large Indian
corporations like Powergrid Corporation, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank
of Commerce and NHDC Ltd.

Before entering the professional world, I spent some of the most
fruitful years of my life studying Electronics and Computers at
[National Institute of Technology, Surat](http://svnit.ac.in). My
interest in computers, internet and Linux dates back to 2000, when my
father bought a computer for me. I had the fastest computer in my school
class. (Intel Celeron 466MHz, 4.3GB HDD, 32MB RAM) That computer still
works and is one of the most awesome things I have ever possesed.


**Random Stuff**

+ I like playing Volleyball and climbing rocks.
+ I used to be a distro hopper in college. There were weeks, when my
machine had a new Linux distro everyday. I have now settled with Ubuntu.
+ I used to hate vi editor. But now I can not live without vim.
